# Client Email Guide - Contact Journal Offering

## Email Bullet Points to Include:

**Key Messages:**
- I made something new to help you between our sessions
- It's a simple way to track your social wins on your phone
- **This is totally optional - not required at all for our work together**
- **But it would be a huge help for tracking your progress**
- You get a special link - just click it, no app needed
- Takes 30 seconds to record when you talk to someone new
- You'll get encouraging feedback right away
- **No extra cost - it's free as part of our sessions**
- **You'd actually be helping ME by testing it out and giving feedback**
- It's totally private - just you and me can see it
- I'm testing it with a few clients first (you're special!)
- Want to try it? Just let me know

**Optional Points (if needed):**
- Works on any phone or computer
- No passwords to remember
- You can stop using it anytime
- Helps us see your progress over time
- Your feedback will help make it better for others

## Tone Notes:

**DO:**
- Write like you're texting a friend
- Use "you" and "I" language
- Keep sentences super short
- Sound excited but not pushy
- Use everyday words only
- **Make it clear they're doing you a favor by trying it**

**DON'T:**
- Use any tech terms
- Make it sound complicated
- Write long paragraphs
- Sound too professional
- Mention "beta" or "pilot" - just say "trying it out" or "testing"
- **Make it sound mandatory or expected**

## Example Openings:
"Hey [Name]! Quick question - want to try something cool I made to help with our social confidence work? Totally optional but would be super helpful!"

## Example Closings:
"No pressure at all! It's not required for our sessions, but if you want to help me test it out, that would be amazing. Let me know!"
